Hello, David. We hope you enjoy our scene. We wanted to comment a few things
about it. First of all, due to the environment we chose, all the terrain is in
one mesh, so it was very hard to pick the gravel from the path in order to change
the type of path for the footsteps. The footsteps change on wood and stone, not
the gravel path. As for music, we prefered to keep it simple, since we could not
find any layered music (the rock one was too much for us), so we used the indoor vs
outdoor environment to show the mixer snapshots. We chose to not add music because,
since the environment is at night, we wanted to make a lot of emphasis on the sounds
that occur around the player, like the crickets, owl, wolf, light buzzing, glowing
shrooms, etc.

Also, don't mind the huge cat, we clearly have problems. Try to stick to the
path, since the triggers and audios are there. The rest of the scene is just plain
forest.

If you have any questions don't hesitate in asking!

Thank you very much,
Paula, Maria and Irene
